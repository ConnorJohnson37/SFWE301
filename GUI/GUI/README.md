## Getting Started

This is the final product of the UASAMS system for SFWE 301. This does not require a package as this was the only way we were all able to run the code without issues.

Running in General: To run this program, you can run the UASAMSGUI.jar file, this will run the GUI.

Running on VScode: To run this project in VSCode, only run the Main.java file using the "Run Java" button on the top right when on the Main.java. This should work and automatically pop up a 
GUI that tells you to choose a certain login. The rest can be done from there.

To login as an admin:
username: Admin (case sensitive)
password: password

To login as a user:
username: Connor (case sensitive)
password: password

Thank you and godspeed and have fun with using this system,
SFWE 301 Team 1
